        <h2>Internship Experiences</h2>
        <p>
            One of the essential experiences recommended during your time as an undergraduate is doing an internship. Gaining work experience is vital for boosting your employability, especially as a business student. After my second year at <strong>BITS Pilani</strong>, I went to <em><strong>Adani Power Ltd., Ahmedabad</strong></em>, to intern for a part of the summer.
I undertook a 7-8 week internship at a corporate office. My fellow academic interns and I were there to learn and understand the inner functioning of a power station's corporate world. Adani Power Limited is committed to ensuring the nation's energy security with thermal and solar power plants across India. After assigning a supervisor, I was expected to report back at the end of the day with an overview of what I had learned.
My eight weeks at Adani Power Ltd. allowed me to grow personally. It also helped me to gain new skills in design, modeling, and simulation —an experience that I did not previously have. I also learned a better understanding of the power industry and gained a few new references. But most importantly, I gained a new sense of professionalism and a more unobstructed view of what it meant to be in the professional world.
